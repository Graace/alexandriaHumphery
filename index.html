        <p>The novella revolves around the life of Efua Johnson, a woman of
          Ghanaian descent living in Lagos with her Nigerian husband. She faces
          an immense dislike from her mother-in-law who is not in support of the
          marriage because she is not a Yoruba woman. The two women are always
          involved in heated discussions and an exchange of not-too-subtle
          insults.
          On the other hand, her friends struggle constantly to navigate the
          Nigerian dating pool. Being the only married one, they come to her for
          advice and she willingly lends a shoulder to cry on when they need it.
          Efua's marriage seems perfect, but is it really or is there a
          terrifying secret threatening to break the mirage that has been her
          life?</p>

        <p>"Nigerian men will stain your white" is an adventurous ride into the world of relationships and marriages as well as all it entails for a Nigerian and African.
        Alex, the author of this beautiful book has done a great job in ensuring that we see love, relationships, heartbreaks and marriages from not just the lens of her heroine, Efua, but also from the lens of every man, woman and relationships which existed in this book.
