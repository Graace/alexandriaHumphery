          <h1>NIGERIA MEN WILL STAIN YOUR WHITE</h1>
          <p>The novella revolves around the life of Efua Johnson, a woman of
            Ghanaian descent living in Lagos with her Nigerian husband. She
            faces
            an immense dislike from her mother-in-law who is not in support of
            the
            marriage because she is not a Yoruba woman. The two women are always
            involved in heated discussions and an exchange of not-too-subtle
            insults.
            On the other hand, her friends struggle constantly to navigate the
            Nigerian dating pool. Being the only married one, they come to her
            for
            advice and she willingly lends a shoulder to cry on when they need
            it.
            Efua's marriage seems perfect, but is it really or is there a
            terrifying secret threatening to break the mirage that has been her
            life?</p>
